## **How to Play**
This game involve 2 role of players. Game Master and Player. Game Master will decide what the secret word and how many times player have to guess. Player then will try to guess what secret word the game master gave before. Player will have no clue about what the word is, no description about the word. But, player can sharpen their guess by looking at number of correct word and its position.

You can try to play it with your friends, your family, your college, even your girlfriend / boyfriend!

## **Final Words**
Thanks for playing this game!  
This mini game is made for me to challenge my self in my learning journey using Python 3. So this game is built upon Python 3. This game doesn't connect to any databases and only run on single file.
